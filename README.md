# Zigbee ESPHome Projects

This Repo Contains ESPHome YAML configurations and other files that might be useful in building Zigbee devices using ESPHome 2025.7.5 (and newer, probably?)

This is made possible by the hard work of @luar123  for the [zigbee_esphome external component.](https://github.com/luar123/zigbee_esphome)

A lot of the code is based on examples in the github repo, but I was having some issues getting started and a lot was discovered by trial and error. I'd like to save you some time and frustration.

# m5stack.md
Contains instructions for making lights and sensors for the M5Stack NanoC6

# xiao.md
Contains instructions for using the XIAO MR60BHA2 60GHz mmWave Human Breathing and Heartbeat Sensor Kit 

# waveshare.md
Contains instructions for using the Waveshare ESP32-C6-DEV-KIT-N8 (and likely other makers too) to make multi sensors
